        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Digital Marketing Program is an 8-month certificate program that consists of 6 core modules that provide
            practical experience and information on skills necessary to succeed in the digital marketing industry.
            Developed by Facebook, this program targets the essential skills that businesses look for when hiring and
            promoting digital marketers.</p>
        <p>The program is completely online. This means that participants can learn whenever they want and wherever they
            are. For this program, online does not mean alone. An industry practitioner, someone with several years of
            experience in the digital marking field, will lead the course, facilitate discussions, answer questions,
            grade assignments, and provide guidance and feedback.</p>
        <p>There are no prerequisites for the program. Participants do not need prior experience and knowledge in
            digital marketing to start the program.</p>
        <p>At the end of the program, participants will have created six professional learning artifacts (such as a
            comprehensive digital marketing plan and an email marketing campaign) that they can place into an
            e-portfolio for employers to review.</p>
        <p>GAP Funding support is available to Nebraska residents who qualify.</p>
