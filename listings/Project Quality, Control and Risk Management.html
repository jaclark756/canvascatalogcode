                            alt="ben godfrey image" />I think of Project Managers as change agents. As a PM, my greatest
                        satisfaction is in knowing that my work changes the world for the better. Operating nuclear
                        power plants for the US Navy; software test engineering for Qualcomm and Sun Microsystems;
                        running my own plastics manufacturing company; raising ultra-organic pigs; operating a nuclear
                        power plant for OPPD; and now working as a PM on the demolition of that same nuclear power
                        plant. I hold certifications from Project Management International in Project Management (PMP)
                        and Risk Management (RMP). I am the current president of OPPD&rsquo;s Project Management
                        Community of Practice.</p>
