        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>This course introduces attendees to the essentials of project management. It approaches project management
            from the standpoint of managing a single, stand-alone project that is small to medium in size. The course
            takes attendees through the project life cycle in the same sequence they would face when managing a real
            project in the workplace. Topics covered include the product and project life cycles, including initiation,
            planning, executing, controlling, and closing. Subject areas addressed include the project charter, creating
            a WBS, Network Diagramming, finalizing the project plan, scope management, stakeholder identification, cost
            management, scheduling and schedule management, earned value measurement, and change control.</p>
        <p>The use of MS Project as an effective planning, scheduling and tracking tool is covered and integrated into
            the Project examples and Labs. Objectives were developed by identifying key basic terms, processes and
            techniques that are commonly used to manage small, stand-alone projects. Key project management framework
            concepts such as the definition of a project, the project management process groups and knowledge areas are
            introduced and followed throughout the course. Protégé trainers reviewed the course objectives to validate
            relevancy of objectives. Terminology, processes and definitions, where appropriate follow the Project
            Management Institute’s (PMI®) Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide).</p>
