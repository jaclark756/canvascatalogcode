        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>MCC real estate pre and post licensing trainings are authorized by the Nebraska Real Estate Commission and
            participants receive a certificate of completion from MCC after successful demonstration of course
            competencies.</p>
        <p>The demand for Pharmacy Technicians continues to grow due to availability of new drugs, national shortage,
            aging population, and establishment of certified technicians. This 160-hour program prepares participants to
            work in pharmacies as pharmacy technicians under the direction of a pharmacist. MCC's program enables
            technicians to work more efficiently with pharmacists to offer safe and effective patient care and service.
            MCC's Pharmacy Technician program is a Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB) recognized program
            authorized to deliver training for the Certified Pharmacy Technician (CPhT) credential. The CPhT
            certification is recognized in all 50 US states. Nebraska, Iowa and most other US states and territories
            require a PTCB or similar certification to work as Pharmacy Technician.</p>
