        <h3>Lean Six Sigma Academy</h3>
        <p>This is a part-time professional learning program in which participants will work through online modules and
            in-person classroom sessions to learn core methodologies of Lean Six Sigma processes. The courses emphasize
            interactive simulations, small group interaction and comprehensive real-world projects. Upon completion of
            the capstone and project for each belt level, participants can earn a MCC Lean Six Sigma Certificate and an
            American Society of Quality (ASQ®) that are recognized and desired in business and industry. What is Lean
            Six Sigma? Lean Six Sigma is a process improvement methodology designed to improve efficiency, eliminate
            waste, mitigate quality issues, and improve working conditions to provide a better response to customers’
            needs. The combination of Lean and Six Sigma tools, methods and principles creates a powerful and
            transformative methodology for improving your organization’s operations, mindset, and culture.</p>

        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>Students entering this training will work detailed Value Stream Maps and will identify areas of waste with an
            in-depth look at the sources of defects and the associated quality issues. They will apply Lean Six Sigma
            tools - including statistical analysis - to reduce sources of waste and then to verify the effectiveness of
            their solutions. This course emphasizes interactive simulations, small group interaction, and a
            comprehensive real-world project in order to gain the distinction of Certified Green Belt. <b>Green belts
                must have completed the Six Sigma Yellow Belt Certification requirements.</b> Upon successful completion
            of
            the project, the participant will become a Certified Green Belt. Certification requires completion of 1
            project
            and 2 capstones. </p>
